# tic-tac-toe
Simple implementation of the game tic tac toe with a GUI.

It's a big work in progress, because it doesn't have any menu yet but we are going to add a few game states later on.

## Algorithm
Behind the scenes it uses the minimax algorithm to choose the best move being the Player.Type.COMPUTER.

## Input (Mouse events)
```java
    public class MouseHandler extends MouseAdapter { ... }
```
A few screen shots of the gameplay:
